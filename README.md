# Citistat Quarto Template

OPI is abandoning powerpoint decks for interactive quarto documents. This is the template for citistat meetings.



The template style can be installed into an existing folder using the following command:

```bash
quarto add city-of-baltimore/citistatQuartoTemplate
```

Alternatively, you can create a new folder and install a quarto file and template style directly using the following command:

```bash
quarto use template city-of-baltimore/citistatQuartoTemplate
```
